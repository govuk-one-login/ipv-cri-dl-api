  Scenario Outline: DVA Driving Licence - Auth Source Happy path
    Given DVA Driving Licence with a signed JWT string with <context>, <personalNumber>, <expiryDate>, <issueDate>, <issuedBy> and <fullAddress> for CRI Id driving-licence-cri-dev and JSON Shared Claims 197
    And Driving Licence user sends a POST request to session endpoint
    And Driving Licence user gets a session-id
    And Driving Licence user sends a GET request to the personInfo endpoint
    When Driving Licence user sends a POST request to Driving Licence endpoint using updated jsonRequest returned from the personInfo Table <JSONPayloadRequest>
    And Driving Licence user gets authorisation code
    And Driving Licence user sends a POST request to Access Token endpoint driving-licence-cri-dev
    Then User requests Driving Licence CRI VC
    And Driving Licence VC should contain validityScore 2 and strengthScore 3
    And Driving Licence VC should contain checkMethod data and identityCheckPolicy published in success checkDetails
    And Driving Licence VC should contain JTI field
    Examples:
