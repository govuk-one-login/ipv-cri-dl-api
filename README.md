Driving Permit Check Credential Issuer

## SDKMan
This project has an `.sdkmanrc` file

Install SDKMan via the instructions on `https://sdkman.io/install`

For auto-switching between JDK versions, edit your `~/.sdkman/etc/config` and set `sdkman_auto_env=true`

Then use sdkman to install Java JDK listed in this projects `.sdkmanrc`
e.g `sdk install java x.y.z-amzn`

Restart your terminal

## Gradle

Gradle 8 is used on this project

## Pre-Commit Checking / Verification

Completely optional, there is a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configuration setup in this repo, this uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to verify your commit before actually commiting, it runs the following checks:

* Check Json files for formatting issues
* Fixes end of file issues (it will auto correct if it spots an issue - you will need to run the git commit again after it has fixed the issue)
* It automatically removes trailing whitespaces (again will need to run commit again after it detects and fixes the issue)
* Detects aws credentials or private keys accidentally added to the repo
* runs cloud formation linter and detects issues
* runs checkov and checks for any issues.

### Dependency Installation
To use this locally you will first need to install the dependencies, this can be done in 2 ways:

#### Method 1 - Python pip

Run the following in a terminal:

```
sudo -H pip3 install checkov pre-commit cfn-lint
```

this should work across platforms

#### Method 2 - Brew

If you have brew installed please run the following:

```
brew install pre-commit ;\
brew install cfn-lint ;\
brew install checkov
```

### Post Installation Configuration
once installed run:
```
pre-commit install
```

To update the various versions of the pre-commit plugins, this can be done by running:

```
pre-commit autoupdate && pre-commit install
```

This will install / configure the pre-commit git hooks,  if it detects an issue while committing it will produce an output like the following:

```
 git commit -a
check json...........................................(no files to check)Skipped
fix end of files.........................................................Passed
trim trailing whitespace.................................................Passed
detect aws credentials...................................................Passed
detect private key.......................................................Passed
AWS CloudFormation Linter................................................Failed
- hook id: cfn-python-lint
- exit code: 4

W3011 Both UpdateReplacePolicy and DeletionPolicy are needed to protect Resources/PublicHostedZone from deletion
core/deploy/dns-zones/template.yaml:20:3

Checkov..............................................(no files to check)Skipped
- hook id: checkov
```

To remove the pre-commit hooks should there be an issue
```
pre-commit uninstall
```

## Build

Build with `./gradlew`

By default, this also calls spotlessApply and runs unit tests

## Linting

Check with `./gradlew :spotlessCheck`

Apply with `./gradlew :spotlessApply`

## Coverage Reports

Generate with `./gradlew reports` placed in `build/reports`

## Deploy

### Prerequisites

See onboarding guide for instructions on how to setup the following command line interfaces (CLI)
- aws cli
- aws-vault
- sam cli
- gds cli

### Deploy to DL dev account

Note deploy.sh has a prefix override set to use the existing dev pipeline parameters and should
not need parameters set unless new ones are being added.

`gds aws gds aws di-ipv-cri-dl-dev-admin -- ./deploy.sh di-ipv-cri-dl-myusernameORticket`

### Delete stack from DL dev account
> The stack name *must* be unique to you and created by you in the deploy stage above.
> Type `y`es when prompted to delete the stack and the folders in S3 bucket

The command to run is:

`gds aws di-ipv-cri-dl-dev-admin -- sam delete --config-env dev --stack-name di-ipv-cri-dl-myusernameORticket`

### Deploy to shared dev account

Note deploy.sh has a prefix override set to use the existing dl-dev pipeline parameters, the prefix will need changed
to "none" and all parameters set in the parameter store.

`gds aws di-ipv-cri-dev -- ./deploy.sh di-ipv-cri-dl-myusernameORticket`

### Delete stack from shared dev account
> The stack name *must* be unique to you and created by you in the deploy stage above.
> Type `y`es when prompted to delete the stack and the folders in S3 bucket

The command to run is:

`gds aws ROLE -- sam delete --config-env dev --stack-name <unique-stack-name>`

### Parameter prefix

This allows a deploying stack to use parameters of another stack.
Created to enable pre-merge integration tests to use the parameters of the pipeline stack.

ParameterPrefix if set, this value is used in place of AWS::Stackname for parameter store paths.
- Default is "none", which will use AWS::StackName as the prefix.

Can also be used with the following limitations in development.
- Existing stack needs to have all the parameters needed for the stack with the prefix enabled.
- Existing stack parameters values if changed will trigger behaviour changes in the stack with the prefix enabled.
- Existing stack if deleted will cause errors in the deployed stack.

## Acceptance Test

In a terminal, change into the acceptance test folder and execute

`./run-local-tests`

Then follow the on-screen prompts.

## Infrastructure Test

In a terminal, change to the rootdirectory

`./gradlew :acceptance-tests:infra-test`

This will execute the TemplateTest to validate the CloudFormation Lambda template.yaml.

### Note

To run API tests locally you need
- A manually deployed api stack with the code (main or branch) that is to be tested.
- A locally running core-stub with a cri id configured for `driving-licence-cri-dev`.

Acceptance tests
- build/staging test can be run against the environments.
- Using a locally running stub and front, with a manually deployed api stack configured to match the environments.

## TestData Strategy

For testing purposes, this CRI has the ability to route users requests to either
a real 3rd Party UAT instance of the service OR route users requests to an internally
managed, stubbed version of the 3rd party service.

Routing for the above is dictated by the client ID sent to the CRI from IPVCore/stubs. For lower
environments there is an IPV core stub that is configured to for routing CRIs to 3rd party stubs and another
IPV core stub that is configured for routing CRIs to the 3rd party UAT environment.

For testing purposes if you wish to route to the stubbed version of the 3rd party then use the following
core stub URL - https://cri.core.stubs.account.gov.uk/
If you wish to route to the real 3rd partys UAT instance of the service use the following
core stub url - https://cri-3rdparty.core.stubs.account.gov.uk/

Additional details on these stubs can be found on this confluence page -

## Canaries
When deploying using sam deploy, canary deployment strategy will be used which is set in LambdaDeploymentPreference in template.yaml file.

When deploying using the pipeline, canary deployment strategy set in the pipeline will be used and override the default set in template.yaml.

Canary deployments will cause a rollback if any canary alarms associated with a lambda are triggered.

To skip canaries such as when releasing urgent changes to production, set the last commit message to contain either of these phrases: [skip canary], [canary skip], or [no canary] as specified in the [Canary Escape Hatch guide](https://govukverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PLAT/pages/3836051600/Rollback+Recovery+Guidance#Escape-Hatch%3A-how-to-skip-canary-deployments-when-needed).
`git commit -m "some message [skip canary]"`

Note: To update LambdaDeploymentPreference, update the LambdaCanaryDeployment pipeline parameter in the [identity-common-infra repository](https://github.com/govuk-one-login/identity-common-infra/tree/main/terraform/lime/dl). To update the LambdaDeploymentPreference for a stack in dev using sam deploy, parameter override needs to be set in the [deploy script](./deploy.sh).
`--parameter-overrides LambdaDeploymentPreference=<define-strategy> \`
